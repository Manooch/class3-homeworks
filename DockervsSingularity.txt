As a developer who works locally on a project, I'd rather use Docker due to the below reasons:

- Time saving: because of the Docker image
- Easier to simulate test and production environment
- Fantastic library

But I would prefer to use Singularity as a developer working in a big project in big team due to the below reasons:

- Seems it's more common than Docker
- More secure than Docker in terms of accessing to Linux kernel. In Docker, by default you have access to it unless an administrator denies your privilege.
- No change in architecture + workflow required
